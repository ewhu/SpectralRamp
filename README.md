# SpectralRamp: A Python-Based Spectral Analysis Framework for Signal Processing
*A comprehensive toolkit for researchers and developers to analyze and visualize spectral dynamics*

SpectralRamp is an open-source Python library designed to facilitate efficient and accurate spectral analysis for signal processing applications. The project aims to provide a robust and flexible framework for researchers and developers to extract valuable insights from complex spectral data. By leveraging cutting-edge algorithms and visualization techniques, SpectralRamp enables users to uncover hidden patterns, trends, and relationships within their data.

The primary purpose of SpectralRamp is to bridge the gap between theoretical spectral analysis and practical applications. It achieves this by offering a suite of tools for data preprocessing, feature extraction, and dimensionality reduction, ultimately enabling users to gain a deeper understanding of their data's spectral properties. Furthermore, SpectralRamp's modular architecture allows for seamless integration with existing workflows and pipelines, making it an ideal choice for a wide range of applications, from biomedical signal processing to financial time series analysis.

Some of the key benefits of using SpectralRamp include:

* **Streamlined data analysis**: SpectralRamp's automated workflows and built-in visualizations enable users to quickly identify and extract meaningful patterns from their data.
* **Improved accuracy**: By leveraging advanced algorithms and statistical techniques, SpectralRamp ensures that results are reliable and accurate, even with noisy or incomplete data.
* **Customizability**: SpectralRamp's modular design allows users to tailor the toolkit to their specific needs, integrating custom algorithms and visualization tools as needed.

## Key Features

* **Spectral Decomposition**: SpectralRamp provides implementation of various spectral decomposition techniques, including Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), Short-Term Fourier Transform (STFT), and Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT).
* **Feature Extraction**: The toolkit includes a range of feature extraction algorithms, such as spectral power density, peak detection, and time-frequency analysis.
* **Dimensionality Reduction**: SpectralRamp offers several dimensionality reduction techniques, including Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Independent Component Analysis (ICA), and t-SNE.
* **Visualization**: The project includes a range of visualization tools, including heatmaps, spectrograms, and scatter plots, designed to facilitate intuitive exploration and interpretation of spectral data.
* **Data Preprocessing**: SpectralRamp provides tools for data normalization, filtering, and resampling, ensuring that data is properly prepared for analysis.

## Technology Stack

* **Python 3.8+**: The primary programming language used for development and scripting.
* **NumPy**: A library for efficient numerical computations and array operations.
* **SciPy**: A library for scientific computing and signal processing.
* **Matplotlib**: A plotting library for visualization and data visualization.
* **Scikit-learn**: A machine learning library for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/ewhu/SpectralRamp.git`
2. Navigate to the repository directory: `cd SpectralRamp`
3. Install required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Install SpectralRamp: `pip install .`

Alternatively, you can install SpectralRamp using pip: `pip install spectralramp`

## Configuration

SpectralRamp relies on several environment variables to customize its behavior:

* `SPECTRALRAMP_DATA_DIR`: The directory where input data is stored.
* `SPECTRALRAMP_OUTPUT_DIR`: The directory where output results are saved.
* `SPECTRALRAMP_LOG_LEVEL`: The logging level (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR).

You can set these variables in your shell configuration file or using the `export` command.

## Usage

SpectralRamp provides a range of APIs for data analysis and visualization. Here's an example of how to perform spectral decomposition on a sample signal:
